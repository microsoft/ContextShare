# Welcome to PromptVault! 🎉

Thank you for installing **PromptVault**! You're about to transform how your team manages and shares AI assistant resources in VS Code.

## What You Can Do Now

✨ **Organize AI Resources**: Keep chat modes, instructions, prompts, and tasks in one place  
🤝 **Share with Your Team**: Store everything in Git so your team can collaborate and improve together  
🎩 **Use Hats (Presets)**: Switch between different AI configurations with one click  
🔄 **Stay in Sync**: Activate the exact same setup across different projects and team members  

## Why You Need This (The Problems We Solve)

### 🎯 **Context Control** - No More AI Overwhelm
**The Problem**: Too much context = confused AI. When you load every instruction and prompt at once, your AI assistant gets distracted, burns through tokens, and loses track of what you're actually trying to accomplish.

**Our Solution**: **Selective activation**. Only activate the resources you need for your current task. Code review? Activate review-specific instructions. Bug fixing? Switch to debugging prompts. Keep your AI focused and efficient.

### 🧹 **Context Clarity** - End Contradictory Instructions  
**The Problem**: Multiple context files with conflicting guidance create "context pollution." Your AI gets mixed signals: "Use TypeScript strict mode" vs "Allow any types for rapid prototyping" - which should it follow?

**Our Solution**: **Curated resource sets**. Use Hats to activate only compatible, complementary resources. No more contradictory instructions fighting each other in your AI's context.

### 🤝 **Team Alignment** - Stop Copy-Paste Chaos
**The Problem**: Teams sharing AI resources via Slack, email, or copy-paste leads to version drift, outdated instructions, and inconsistent AI behavior across team members.

**Our Solution**: **Git-based sharing** with version control. Your team's AI resources live in your repo, get reviewed in PRs, and everyone stays in sync automatically.

### ⚡ **Token Efficiency** - Save Money and time, Get Better Results
**The Problem**: Loading unnecessary context wastes tokens and degrades response quality. Why pay for 50 irrelevant instructions when you only need 5 relevant ones?

**Our Solution**: **Just-in-time activation**. Your AI gets exactly the context it needs, nothing more. Better responses, lower costs, happier developers.

## Key Concepts

### 📚 **Catalog**
Your source of truth - a folder containing `chatmodes/`, `instructions/`, `prompts/`, `tasks/`, `mcp/`, and `hats/` subfolders with your AI resources.

### 🎩 **Hats (Presets)**
Named collections of resources that you can activate as a set. Perfect for roles like "Code Reviewer", "HW Designer", or project-specific setups.

### ✅ **Active Resources** 
Resources that are currently copied to your runtime directory (default: `.github/`) where VS Code can use them.

### 🏠 **Target Workspace**
Where your active resources get copied. Usually the same as your current workspace, but can be configured to activate resources elsewhere.

## How It Works: Catalog → Workspace Flow

```

🎩 HAT PRESETS: Apply multiple resources at once
   "Frontend Dev" → activates 5 resources instantly
   "Code Review"  → activates 3 different resources
```

**The Magic**: Resources stay in your catalog (versioned, shared), but get copied to `.github/` only when you need them active in VS Code.

---

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Start by creating a simple Hat with just a few resources, then gradually add more as you discover what works best for your workflow.
