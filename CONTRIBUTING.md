# Contributing to ContextHub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ContextHub! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18+ with npm
- **Visual Studio Code**: Version 1.90.0 or later
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.4+
- **Git**: For version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-contexthub.git
   cd vscode-contexthub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Extension**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

We follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach and adhere to strict quality gates:

### 1. **Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor Cycle**

1. **REPRO** (for bugs): Reproduce the issue manually
2. **RED**: Write a failing test first that demonstrates the problem
3. **GREEN**: Implement the minimal code to make the test pass
4. **REFACTOR**: Clean up the implementation while keeping tests green

### 2. **Version Management**

- Update `package.json` version following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Keep `vsix/extension.vsixmanifest` version synchronized
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-visible changes
- Place new changelog entries at the TOP (newest first)

### 3. **Quality Gates**

Before any pull request:

```bash
# 1. Clean build (must succeed)
rm -rf dist/
npm run build

# 2. Run all tests (must pass)
npm test

# 3. Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Package extension (Windows only)
pwsh ./build_vsix.ps1
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing Requirements

- **Every bug fix** must include a new test that would fail without the fix
- **Every new feature** must have corresponding test coverage
- Tests should be fast, deterministic, and independent
- Avoid network calls in tests (use mocks when needed)

### Test Categories

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Unit Tests | `test/*.test.ts` | Fast, isolated logic testing |
| Integration Tests | `test/integration/` | Component interaction testing |
| E2E Tests | `test/e2e/` | Full workflow testing |

## üåü Contribution Types

We welcome various types of contributions:

### üêõ Bug Fixes

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Reproduce the bug** and create a minimal test case
3. **Write a failing test** that demonstrates the issue
4. **Implement the fix** to make the test pass
5. **Update documentation** if behavior changes

### ‚ú® New Features

1. **Discuss the feature** by opening an issue first
2. **Design the API** and get feedback from maintainers
3. **Write tests** for the expected behavior
4. **Implement the feature** incrementally
5. **Update documentation** and examples

### üìö Documentation

1. **Improve README** and setup guides
2. **Add code examples** and usage patterns
3. **Update API documentation** for new features
4. **Fix typos** and improve clarity

### üß™ Testing

1. **Increase test coverage** for existing code
2. **Add edge case tests** that weren't previously covered
3. **Improve test reliability** and reduce flakiness
4. **Add performance tests** for critical paths

## üìã Pull Request Process
