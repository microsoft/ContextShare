# Prompt: Initialize a Copilot Catalog in this Workspace

Goal: Help me set up a Copilot Catalog that I can share with my team, and remind me of my responsibilities.

Constraints:
- Do NOT answer non-catalog questions; refuse and redirect to catalog setup.
- Keep responses concise; show only the minimal steps.

What I need now:
1) How to create the template catalog and where to put it
2) How to configure rootCatalogPath or per-category sources and targetWorkspace
3) How to activate/deactivate a resource and apply a Hat
4) What I must own (security reviews, versioning, publishing)
